# EAMMH
Energy Aware Multi-hop Multi-path Hierarchical Routing Protocol in WSN

Built on (NetworkSimulator) ns-2.35

Sorry, I've lost the full compilable copy of EAMMH source.
This copy contains - 
	1. almost complete source code
	2. files within ns2 framework to be modified
	3. Make file changes for modified and newly added modules

If you can download ns-2.35, you can plugin above changes and probably build & simulate EAMMH and LEACH WSN routing protocols
